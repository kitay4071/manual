+Page Shot:Area shown *for Web site
On using 'Page Shot:Area shown', Whole Page in Horizontal(width) direction of page need to be shown.
Otherwise Picture shot have lack of area in sides.
* Other Way: Left side end shown always for 'Page Shot:Area shown'.


+Page Shot:Whole(.mht) 
For some Site(especially Sites having Fixed bars on top or bottom and contents page scrolling inside that),
'whole shot with mht' may take only Top or Bottom Bars(no other page contents).

recommended to Confirm the mht file after downloding with opening it(in this app by Clicking the mht file).
* Some MHT file takes time to Open.
* In case that only some of pictures in page lost, wait all pictures to shown in the page(scloll down page to bottom,etc) ,then do 'Shot Whole(MHT)' operation. 

If contents not shot by MHT by anyway, please use 'Page Shot:Area shown' or 'Screenshot',insteadly.


+"This name already Exist" shown and cannot Save in Picture(.etc) Saving:
