<BR><BR>
(How to Open that extensioned file)
<BR>

<BR><BR>
(Operation)
<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Long-Click file(or folder) on File-List pane which has Extension to set.
<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Select "Extension Setting for [xxx]" in popup menu.

<BR><BR>

<BR>
Methods for open not selected here are shown in Popup Menu by Long-Clicking file item(with some exception).
<BR>
* In preference, can set "External App (Old protocol)" not shown in Popup.
<BR><BR>
By Default, files with main Picture or Video Extension are set to be opened with Built-in Browser and
Text file with Built-in Editor.
<BR>
* This app's original extensions (tellnk, follnk etc.) or extensions with fixed way to Open(apk etc.) can not be set.

<BR><BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;"External App (Old protocol)" : used mainly for Apps (or app's Versions) for Android 5 or 6.
<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;"External App"(=by New protocol) : mainly for Apps (or app's Versions)  for Android 7 or later.
<BR><BR>
If an app you like to use not shown in Selection List(Android shows) with selecting 'External App',
try the other 'External App' in Old or New.
<BR>
There is no guarantee that file can be opened normally in one of these external-App call. Recent Google's security Restriction 
is much strong especially to SD Card and Other Apps Call(Google seems to be reluctant for users to utilize external storage except cloud).
<BR>
<BR>
If you have a file be read-only or can't use that App's full features when the file opened by external app and it not satisfy your demands, try below.
<BR>
 - If the file is in SD Card, move(or Copy) to Inner storage and open it.
<BR>
 - If you want to use file with full features anyhow, launch the external app and open the file from that app.
(This way is rational in a sense and probably desired by Google for now, though it is low-convenient and not smart for users...).
