CAUTION:
if Connection Lost under Editing File directly in Outer Drive 'via USB' or Copying File to that Drive, Contents of that file may be lost even if file name be shown.
+Recommended NOT to Edit file directly in Outer Drive via USB(insteadly After copying a file to Smartphone's Drive and Edit the file on the Smartphone).
+Use 'Copy' not 'Move' between Drive via USB and drive of Smartphone.
+Confirm file size of copied file (or try to open file and confirm its contents) after Copying.
* There is no problem between SD in Slot of Smartphone and Smartphone's main Drive.

First of all, Outer drive(SD or SSD) to connect needs to have FAT or exFAT format.(NTFS can Read in some phone,but cannot Write to,perhaps) 
 
+ You need to restart App after connecting USB SD card(to show outer drive in App(Upper Path bar works as ComboBox)
 
+ Portable SSD:
 Small type such as finger-size, might be recognized. Large size SSD basically cannot be detected.
 Even if Portable SSD is not recognized, SD Card can be recognized.

CAUTION:
For video file,it seems to takes a few or about 10 minutes to get stable-playback.
Till getting stable connection, most of Video files Playback may Error-Stop after a few minitues play, even if those video files shown(and thumbnails also) in this App.
Perhaps as to transfer speed of your device or cache mechanism of file system, but I don't know that reason exactly.
